# ðŸŽˆ Maternal Health Risk Prediction App

This application uses a Random Forest model to predict the risk level of maternal health based on various input features. The model has been trained on a dataset containing features such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, and heart rate. The risk levels are categorized as:

Low risk (2)
Moderate risk (1)
High risk (0)

The app allows users to input patient details and receive a risk prediction. It also includes sections for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and contact information.

The machine learning model was trained on historical patient data with known outcomes. The model achieves:

   - Accuracy: ~87%
   - Precision: ~96% 
   - Recall: ~95%
   - ROC-AUC: ~95%

   These metrics indicate good but not perfect predictive ability. Always consult healthcare professionals for 
   medical decisions.
